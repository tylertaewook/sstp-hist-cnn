<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was an attempt to design a hybrid model that incorporates a stackable, localized histogram layer on CNN for texture classification analysis. We used RBF (Radial Basis Function) for localized binning operation without binning contraints and evaluated its performance on KTH-TIPS 2b dataset.

![Research](/images/research.png)

The research was done in University of Florida as part of their 2019 SSTP (Student Science Training Program). [UF SSTP](https://www.cpet.ufl.edu/students/uf-cpet-summer-programs/student-science-training-program/) is a seven week residential research program for that emphasizes in research participation with a UF faculty research scientist and his or her research team.
I worked in Professor Alina Zare's [Machine Learning and Sensing Lab](https://faculty.eng.ufl.edu/machine-learning/) and assisted with my mentor Joshua Peeples's  research 'Histogram Layer for Texture Classification'. As this is an on-going research, I am not allowed to publish any code under research security agreement. The lead author Joshua Peeples expects to publish the final article in 2022 Spring along with my co-authorship.

![Presentation](/images/presentation.png)

In the span of seven weeks, I modeled my own CNN model, performed experiments with different parameters, wrote a 5-page article, and gave a 10-minute presentation in front of SSTP student body. At the closing ceremony, my paper was awarded with 'Best Research Paper' in Computer Science division.
