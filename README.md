## About The Project

![Research](/images/research.png)

ML texture analysis research in 2019 UF SSTP that implements deep network models in PyTorch for texture analysis applications.


<!-- UF SSTP -->
### UF SSTP

"[The University of Florida Student Science Training Program (UF SSTP)](https://www.cpet.ufl.edu/students/uf-cpet-summer-programs/student-science-training-program/) is a seven week residential research program for selected students entering senior year. The program emphasis is research participation with a UF faculty research scientist and his or her research team."

"Students engage in the ongoing research of the faculty-mentor for 30 hours each week, attend a daily lecture series on current research topics, and participate in a UF honors seminar class.  Additionally, students develop important interpersonal, leadership, professional communication, and organizational skills through academic, social, and service activities." (Extracted from SSTP website's descriptions)
